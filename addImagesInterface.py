## display the images of the user-input tumblr blog
## go through image posts one at a time
## save the captions + tags to database, also the source (if there) associated with the image/images
## when entering tags, be able to see the most common tags
## when entering tags, be able to see other images in a preview that fit the description
## when entering tags for multiple images, be able to edit previous tags for the images rather than typing them out completely

## when done typing out tags and selecting images, be able to continue to the next image post.

##add widgets here

##widget to add blog name

##widget to show images in a nice grid (if multiple)

##widget to add post to the database

##widget to add tags,
    ##when typing in tags, show the number of posts that are under the tag (total) like tag|number of posts
    ##when adding more tags, show the posts that fall under all of the tags in the field (like a red field is shown with tags red, landscape)
    ##when deleting tags, show the updated posts that fall under all of the tags in the field
    ##when editing tags, ensure that the next image keeps the same tags as the last image in the post

##widget to add file name-- eh.. tags are probably enough to describe the image itself
##so when saving the image itself to the database save it with the specific file name
